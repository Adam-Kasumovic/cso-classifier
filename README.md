# CSO-Classifier

Script that classifes content from scientific papers with the topics of the [Computer Science Ontology (CSO)](https://cso.kmi.open.ac.uk). Being able to synthesize the content of papers, allows to perform different kinds of analytics:
* Trend analysis
* Recommender systems
* Find authorsâ€™ topics of interest
* Topic analysis


## About

If you use the CSO classfier in your research or work and would like to cite the SKM3 Application Programming Interface, we suggest you cite the [CSO portal paper](http://oro.open.ac.uk/55908/).

In v1 folder you find the version of the classifier published as [poster paper at ISWC 2018](http://oro.open.ac.uk/55908/)
In v2 folder you find the version submitted to JCDL 2019. [Pre-print](http://skm.kmi.open.ac.uk/the-cso-classifier-ontology-driven-detection-of-research-topics-in-scholarly-articles/)
The v2 folder is a work in progress folder. I plan to comlete the works on 1 Feb 2019
