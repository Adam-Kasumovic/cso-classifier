# CSO-Annotator

Script that annotates content from scientific papers with the topics of the [Computer Science Ontology (CSO)](https://cso.kmi.open.ac.uk). Being able to synthesize the content of papers, allows to perform different kinds of analytics:
* Trend analysis
* Recommender systems
* Find authorsâ€™ topics of interest
* Topic analysis

## Framework
![Framework of CSO Annotator](/pics/framework.png "Framework of CSO Annotator")

## In depth
1. The algorithm firstly preprocesses the content of each paper: removes punctuation and stop words.
2. Then, it parses the text to find n-grams (unigram, bigrams and trigrams) that match, with a certain degree of similarity (default: Levenshtein >= 0.85), with the topics within the Computer Science Ontology.
3. Thirdly, it adds more broader generic topics, based on the ones retrieved in Step 2. It exploits the _skos:broaderGeneric_ relationships within the CSO. A more broader topic is included if a certain amount of children (default: num_children = 2) are in the initial set of topics.
4. Lastly, it cleans the output removing statistic values, and removes similar topics using the _relatedEquivalent_ within the CSO.

## Instance
Input:
```json
paper = {"title": "Detection of Embryonic Research Topics by Analysing Semantic Topic Networks",
         "abstract": "Being aware of new research topics is an important asset for anybody involved in the research environment, including researchers, academic publishers and institutional funding bodies. In recent years, the amount of scholarly data available on the web has increased steadily, allowing the development of several approaches for detecting emerging research topics and assessing their trends. However, current methods focus on the detection of topics which are already associated with a label or a substantial number of documents. In this paper, we address instead the issue of detecting embryonic topics, which do not possess these characteristics yet. We suggest that it is possible to forecast the emergence of novel research topics even at such early stage and demonstrate that the emergence of a new topic can be anticipated by analysing the dynamics of pre-existing topics. We present an approach to evaluate such dynamics and an experiment on a sample of 3 million research papers, which confirms our hypothesis. In particular, we found that the pace of collaboration in sub-graphs of topics that will give rise to novel topics is significantly higher than the one in the control group.",
         "keywords": "Scholarly Data, Research Trend Detection, Topic Emergence Detection, Topic Discovery, Semantic Web, Ontology"
        }
```

Running the annotator:
```python
'''
# cso is a dictionary loaded beforehand
# num_children = 1, all the broader topics with at least one child matched is included in the final list of topics
# min_similarity = 0.9, more precise similarity between n-grams and topics has been requested
'''
result = CSO.cso_annotator(paper, cso, format = 'json', num_children = 1, min_similarity = 0.9)
json.dumps(result)
```
Result (variable **_result_**):
```json
{  
   "semantics":[  
      {  
         "matched":"semantic",
         "similarity":0.9411764705882353
      },
      {  
         "matched":"semantic",
         "similarity":0.9411764705882353
      },
      {  
         "matched":1,
         "parent of":[  
            "ontology"
         ]
      },
      {  
         "matched":1,
         "parent of":[  
            "semantic web"
         ]
      }
   ],
   "semantic":[  
      {  
         "matched":"semantic",
         "similarity":1.0
      },
      {  
         "matched":"semantic",
         "similarity":1.0
      },
      {  
         "matched":1,
         "parent of":[  
            "ontology"
         ]
      },
      {  
         "matched":1,
         "parent of":[  
            "semantic web"
         ]
      }
   ],
   "ontology":[  
      {  
         "matched":"ontology",
         "similarity":1.0
      }
   ],
   "semantic web":[  
      {  
         "matched":"semantic web",
         "similarity":1.0
      }
   ],
   "world wide web":[  
      {  
         "matched":1,
         "parent of":[  
            "semantic web"
         ]
      }
   ]
}
```

and then cleaning the result:
```python
topics = CSO.clear_explanation(result, cso)
json.dumps(topics)
```

List of topics (variable **_topics_**):
```json
[  
   "semantic web",
   "ontology",
   "semantics",
   "world wide web"
]
```
